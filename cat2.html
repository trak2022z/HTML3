        <!-- In this example, I am citing in the page source.

             Notice that the URL for the site where I got the image is different
             from the URL for the image itself. A good trick for keeping track of where
             I found the image is to add the site as a comment here, which also work
             (for our purposes) as a citation.

             This image is made available with a CC0 Public Domain licenese so I don't
             *have* to attribute it, but it is good to do so anyway.
